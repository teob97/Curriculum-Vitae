\makerubrichead{Research Interests}

I am a curious and passionate physics graduate student. I'm really interested in Astrophysics and Cosmology: in particular, I would like to continue my research activity studying the \textbf{Cosmic Microwave Background}  and the \textbf{Large-Scale Structure} of the Universe in order to understand its history and evolution.

Furthermore, I'm also interested in computer science applied to physics: during my years of study I had the opportunity to delve into data analysis, numerical simulations and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and generative models using Python and its libraries such as Keras or scikit-learn.

As an example of the above, during my thesis, I had the opportunity to be enrolled in international CMB projects such as LiteBIRD and LSPE/Strip: here I was able to study generative neural networks, pointing reconstruction using quaternion algebra and signal separation algorithms.
